1. What is Base Builder?<br>
<br>
Base Builder is a custom game mode for Counter-Strike which consists in builders (CTs) using objects in a map to build bases against zombies (TRs).<br>
Originally made by Tirant, this game mode gained a lot of popularity due to the endless possibilities the builders have to build unique bases.<br>
In the author's own words: "Because every user is different and will like to build their own different styles of bases, every round is different. It is nearly impossible to recreate exact bases (unless the user has practiced significantly), so playing one map won't get too old too quickly."<br>
<br>
2. How do I play it?<br>
<br>
Base Builder is divided into 3 phases: the build phase, the preparation phase and the defend phase.<br>
During the build phase, the builders must build their own bases by looking at an object and holding down their "+use" key (E by default). The object will turn into a pure color and transparent. While the builder is holding down their "+use" key, they can move it by looking at where they want it to go.<br>
Additionally, the builder can use their "+attack" key (Mouse Left Click by default) and their "+attack2" key (Mouse Right Click by default) to push or pull the object respectively. When the builder is satisfied with the object's location, they can release their "+use" key and it will become a solid object.<br>
Moreover, the builder can use their "+reload" key (R by default) to rotate the object by 90 degrees while grabbing the object.<br>
Also, the builder can use their spray key (T by default) to lock/unlock the object (up to 15 locked objects), regardless of whether or not they're grabbing the object, which will turn the object into a pure color and transparent, making it unmovable for other players (with exceptions).<br>
Finally, the builder can use their flashlight key (F by default) to copy the object (up to 5 copies), regardless of whether or not they're grabbing the object, except if the object is locked by another builder (with exceptions).<br>
After the build phase is over, the preparation phase will begin and builders will be respawned to test their bases before the zombies are released. In this phase, builders are no longer able to build and may use their "buy" key (B by default) to open a menu to buy weapons. Upon buying their weapons, builders receive an HE grenade.<br>
After the preparation phase is over, the defend phase will begin and the barrier keeping the zombies confined will be removed, allowing them to start attacking the builders. In this phase, builders who die will respawn as a zombie and zombies respawn upon death until the round is over.<br>
If the round time expires, the builders win the round. If the zombies kill all humans before the round time expires, the zombies win the round.<br>
